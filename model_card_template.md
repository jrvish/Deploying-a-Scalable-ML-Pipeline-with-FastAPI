## Model Details

A Logical Regession model was used in this analysis.

## Intended Use
The intended use of this model was to analyze the Census Income Data from a 1994 Census dataset. The goal was to predict whether someone made over $50,000 per year based on the census data. The overall project was to teach us about how to deploy a Machine Learning pipeline. 

## Training Data
The data used came from a 1994 Census Income dataset.
There are 14 features in the dataset that are either Integers or Categorical. 
## Evaluation Data
